# Which-Debts-Are-Worth-the-Banks-Effort
The aim of this project is to determine if the cost a bank spends in following up on debtors is actually worth the amount through a method called regression discontinuity.
In the solution.ipynb file, there are variety of processes performed on the data. This includes:
Graphical EDA:
 -- The relationship between the expected_recovery_amount other variables such as age, actual_recovery_amount were higlighted.
Statistical Tests:
-- To confirm some hypotheses, I performed some statistcal test namely the Kruskal-Wallis test and the chi-square test.
Regression modeling
-- The regression algorithm used for this data was ordinary least squares method. Using this algorithm, I was able to arrive at certain conclusions with further evidence.
Following this processes I was able to arrive at a conclusion, which can be further examined in the solution.ipynb file
